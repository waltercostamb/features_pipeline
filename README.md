# Features pipeline

This is a snakemake pipeline to extract features from bacterial genomes. The final product will be delivered to Swapnil and available for use for the VEO/MGX groups.

According to https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/tutorial.html#tutorial, "a Snakemake workflow scales without modification from single core workstations and multi-core servers to cluster or batch systems.". Our aim with this pipeline is for users of the VEO/MGX groups to be able to use the pipeline in draco using the power of the slurm cluster.
